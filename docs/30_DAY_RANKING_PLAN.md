## Red Flags & How to Handle Them

### If You're Not Seeing Results by Day 15:
1. **Check GSC for indexing issues** - Are pages being crawled?
2. **Verify technical setup** - Schema markup, sitemaps working?
3. **Review content quality** - Is it truly better than competitors?
4. **Analyze backlink quality** - Are you building relevant, high-quality links?
5. **Double down on quick wins** - Focus on ultra-low competition keywords first

### If Specific Tool Pages Aren't Ranking:
1. **Analyze top 10 competitors** - What are they doing differently?
2. **Add more depth** - Make your content 2x better than #1 result
3. **Build targeted backlinks** - Get links specifically to that page
4. **Improve user signals** - Reduce bounce rate, increase time on page
5. **Add multimedia** - Videos, images, infographics
